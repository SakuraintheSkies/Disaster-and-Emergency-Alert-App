## 🧩 Layers & Components

Each screen is built using well-structured, named layers for ease of editing and handoff:

- **Atomic Design Principles**: Components like buttons, cards, and icons reused across frames.
- **Naming Convention**: `component_name/frame_functionality` format for clarity.
- **Auto Layout**: Responsive alignment for different device sizes.

---

## ✨ Interaction & Animation Settings

- **Prototyping**: Figma's built-in prototyping links between frames.
- **Transitions**: "Smart Animate" used for smooth slide-in and pop-up effects.
- **Triggers**: Tap, Drag, and On-Click interactions applied on buttons and icons.
- **Delay Timing**: 300ms - 500ms easing with "Ease Out" for natural feel.
